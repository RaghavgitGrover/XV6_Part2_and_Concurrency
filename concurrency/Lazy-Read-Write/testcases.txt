Q17. Can a user perform two tasks simultaneously. For example, can user 1 read file 1, and write to file 1 simultaneously?
[IG] YES
Q33. If a single user makes two different read requests on the same file (such that the second read request would execute before the first read request is completed), how is that supposed to be treated? Is the second request supposed to be delayed, declined, etc.? If it supposed to be taken up immediately without delay, does that count as 2 different users accessing the file in terms of "c" (the maximum number of users that can access a file at a given time)?
[IG] We will not be testing such cases. If you wish to handle this, it would be treated as 2 different users accessing the file.

Q22 and Q23. If an operation example WRITE completes at 6s then another WRITE on the same file which arrived at 4s, then the next WRITE should start at 6s or 7s? Essentially, if an operation completes at ts then can another operation start at ts on the same file?
[KM] Yes. The only requirement is that LAZY waits 1 second from the time of the request's arrival before it can take that request up. Assuming that another request arrived on the same file before t seconds, LAZY should indeed be able to pick it up as soon as some other request on that same file is done processing

Q38. Say if a write request is completed at t seconds, and a delete request and a read/write request are both ready to be executed at the same time then is it ok to assume that whichever request arrived earlier would be given the prefference? Also what should be done if in the same scenario both a read and a delete request arrived at (t-1)s , which should be executed at (t)s ?
[IG] You can assume that. In case both request arrive at same t-1 seconds, READ should be preferred.
